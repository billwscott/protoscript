- IE7 now works again: IE does not like straying commas in object literals; these have now been removed throughout (they were removed on the website, but apparently not committed to Subversion).
- Protoscripter did not work in IE7, now it does - at least if using yui_loader.js as the bookmarklet). 
- The following demos does not work:
  * Close demo not working in Opera,http://code.google.com/p/protoscript/issues/detail?id=10.
  * Move demo not working in Opera and IE, http://code.google.com/p/protoscript/issues/list?ts=1205278893&thanks=11.
  * Animate demo not working in IE7, see http://code.google.com/p/protoscript/issues/detail?id=2.
  * ToggleShowHide demo not working on first click in IE, see http://code.google.com/p/protoscript/issues/detail?id=3.
